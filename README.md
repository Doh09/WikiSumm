The script is supposed to be hosted in a serverless function. Such as a Digital Ocean Function with Python 3.11. 

The variables are from environment variables set in the functions settings. You can choose to use DOCTL or work via the Digital Ocean website depending on your  preference.

The Digital Ocean website also allows you to set up 3 cronjobs as triggers.

What the script does is to fetch a Wikipedia text, send it to Gemini with a prompt instructing it to summarize the text.

It then sends the summarized text, alongside the URL for the Wikipedia article, to the X developer portal.

Consequently a post is made with the summary and URL of the Wikipedia article.

Since this is hosted in a serverless cloud environment that allows for cronjobs to be triggered. And since it picks random articles.

This means that it is a bot that posts summarized versions of articles at given intervals.

A thing to keep in mind when setting it up. Is that you must use the API keys, tokens and so forth from the bot accounts developer portal login.

You must also be sure to set up the app on the developer portal with read/write settings. And connect the bot account to your own account.

This allows you to have the right permissions to post tweets. And it connects your own account with the bot account. To showcase who owns and maintains the bot.

Indicating who maintains the bot is a requirement to follow the X policies and to be allowed to post with a bot account.

All the keys and tokens in the script are retrieved from environment variables that Digital Ocean has in its setting for the script/cloud function.
